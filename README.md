# Manipulating-NBA-All-Star-Data
Live Project "How to think of Manipulating Data" from Manning Publications.

The project consisted of getting and manipulation data from the NBA all star games. The first task was to get the information from wikipedia, to work it into a certain format and finally answer some questions about the data such as: What is the maximum and minimum point differential in an NBA all star game and how often did each take place? If a city hosted the game more than once, what was the average score for the Eastern Conference and Western Conference?
